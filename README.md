# OS_Virtual_Memory_Project

Virtual Memory is an essential part of memory management system. This project is an attempt
understand the complex internal working of the virtual memory. We have used Basic code given
by University of Notre-Dame at the following links:
1. Project guide on Course Website of Notre Dame University: www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse30341/spring2017/project5/ 
2. Base source code www3.nd.edu/\~dthain/courses/cse30341/spring2017/project5/ 
for simulating virtual memory in the user environment.
This allows for working with high level programming language rather than working at the kernel
level. Page fault handling has been implemented in an incremental manner. 
Further three page replacement algorithms namely Random, FIFO, LRU have been implemented. 
Finally, comparison of the performance of page replacement algorithms has been done to get a better understanding of the working of system.
The detailed theory, understanding, observations and results have been included in the project report.
